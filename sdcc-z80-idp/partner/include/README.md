# Partner Include Files

Place your Iskra Delta Partner header files (`.h` files) here.

Example files:
- `partner.h` - Partner system calls and definitions
- `vdu.h` - Video display unit definitions
- `disk.h` - Disk I/O definitions
- Any other Partner-specific `.h` files

These files will be copied to `/opt/partner/include/` in the Docker image and will be automatically included in the compiler's search path.
